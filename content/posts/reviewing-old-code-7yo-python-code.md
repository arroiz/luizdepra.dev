Recently I was browsing my Gist collection and I came across a pair of 7 years old Python codes. Seeing these lines brought me back good old memories from that times. I was a C# developer at Positivo back then and I just got into learning Python, which was a recommendation of a friend of mine, Rodrigo Delduca.

- Python 2
- Learning over time
- Review the code: what i did wrong, what is right
