My name is Luiz de Prá and I live in Curitiba, Brazil, with my wife and dog. Currently, I'm working as a python developer at [olist][olist]. Before that, I was a C++ and C# developer, and I also had a little experience as a game developer. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science from [Universidade Federal do Paraná][ufpr], and a game development specialization from the [Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná][pucpr].

I'm interested in software engineering in general: Data structures, algorithms, protocols, architecture, design patterns and much more. Also, I really enjoy learning and experimenting new tools and languages. Just recenlty, I started to engage more in the open source community, attending to meetups and conferences, and, of course, contributing. And in my spare time, I like to play and make games, read books, and watch movies and series. I'm also planning to learn woodworking.

So, this is my blog, my most procrastinated project. I wish you can learn something from here. If you want to stay in touch, leave a comment or reach me at [Twitter][twitter]. You should check my projects at [Github][github], and don't forget to subscribe to this blog's [RSS feed][feed].
